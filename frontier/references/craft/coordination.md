# Craft: Coordination (events, logistics, multi-party projects, run-of-show, itineraries)

What excellent coordination IS, checkable. Estimation craft lives in decisions.md; ops.md
covers running software; this file covers orchestrating people, vendors, and time toward a
fixed moment.

## 1. Work backwards from the immovable moment

- The event date, launch moment, or departure time is fixed; everything schedules backwards
  from it with named owners and explicit buffer at every handoff (on the critical path, at
  least 20% of the preceding leg's duration).
- Identify the critical path (the chain where any slip moves the date) and watch it weekly,
  then daily in the final week; slack anywhere else is irrelevant.
- Milestones are verifiable states ("venue contract signed"), not activities ("working on
  venue").
- Every open decision carries a decide-by date derived from lead times on the critical path;
  an undecided item past its decide-by date is a slip already, log it as one.

## 2. One source of truth

- One living document (tracker, run-of-show) that everyone works from, with an owner and a
  visible last-updated date. Plans living across chat threads are not plans.
- Verbal and chat agreements land in the document the same day, with owner and date.
- Changes are announced, not silently edited: name who is affected and what they must now do
  differently. "FYI, doc updated" is a silent edit with extra steps.
- Change freeze from 48 hours out: only the clock owner approves changes, and each approved
  change is announced to everyone it touches.

## 3. Dependencies and vendors

- Every dependency line has: an owner, a due date, and a confirmation loop. Confirmed means a
  named person replied restating the deliverable, time, and place; a sent message confirms
  nothing, and second-hand confirmation ("A says B is set") is not confirmation. The standing
  rule: unconfirmed means not happening. Re-confirm everything inside 48 hours of need.
- Vendor agreements state the deliverable, the exact time and place, the cost, and the
  cancellation terms, in writing (sales.md section 5 applies to the negotiation).
- Single points of failure identified explicitly: the venue, the keynote speaker, the demo,
  the caterer, the one person with the access codes.

## 4. Contingency (plan B is written AND exercised, not vibed)

- Every single point of failure gets a written plan B WITH its trigger condition and time
  ("if the projector feed is not confirmed by Tuesday 5pm, we switch to local playback").
- A plan B counts only once exercised: the local playback actually played on the venue
  machine, the backup route actually timed, the understudy actually rehearsed. An untested
  plan B is a plan to improvise.
- Day-of kit prepared: contact sheet (every vendor and person, phone numbers), the printed
  timeline, spares for whatever breaks most (cables, adapters, badges, chargers).
- Weather, travel, and tech get default plan Bs even when they seem fine.

## 5. Run-of-show (live moments)

- Minute-by-minute for anything live: time, what happens, who owns it, tech and cue notes
  per line. Scan it for the same name owning two overlapping lines; one person cannot be in
  two places.
- Rehearse the TRANSITIONS (mic handoffs, screen switches, walk-ons) on the real equipment in
  the real room where possible; segments rarely fail, handoffs always do, and a verbal
  walkthrough is not a rehearsal.
- One person owns the clock during the event and has authority to cut or stretch; everyone
  knows who that is.
- Each owner gets a personal cue sheet (their lines only, with times); nobody parses the full
  grid mid-event.

## 6. Communication cadence

- Right-sized updates: weekly digest to everyone involved, daily standup for the core group
  in the final week, a named escalation contact throughout.
- After each milestone, a two-line debrief into the document (what slipped, what to change);
  after the event, a full debrief while memory is fresh.

## 7. Itineraries and travel

- Buffers between legs sized to consequences: never minimum connection times for
  must-attend commitments.
- Every line carries: local time WITH timezone, address, confirmation number, and the
  fallback (next flight, backup route).
- Offline copy exists (PDF or print); one plan B per critical leg; arrival day is not the
  performance day for anything important.

## 8. Budget

- Line items each with an owner; committed vs estimated flagged distinctly; a 10-15%
  contingency line that is not an apology.
- Reconcile actuals afterwards and record the deltas; next event inherits calibrated numbers
  (decisions.md estimation rules).

## 9. Ban list

- Zero-buffer schedules; "someone will handle it" (unowned lines); milestones phrased as
  activities.
- Plans living in chat scrollback; silent edits to shared plans.
- Assumptions unconfirmed 24 hours out; vendors without written terms.
- Status theater (a tracker all green because nobody checked); every "done" names who
  confirmed it and how.
- Rescheduling a slipped task without naming the cause (the plan changed, reality did not).
- Bus factor of one (a single person holding the timeline, codes, or contacts in their head).
- Improvising transitions on the day; skipping the debrief because it went "fine".

## 10. Verification checklist (every pass)

1. Backwards timeline exists with the critical path marked and buffered (20% per handoff)?
2. Every line: owner + date + confirmation status visible? Decide-by dates set, none passed?
3. All dependencies re-confirmed inside the 48-hour window, by direct reply, not relay?
4. Written plan B with trigger for each single point of failure, and each one exercised?
5. Run-of-show rehearsed at the transitions on real equipment; clock owner named; no owner
   double-booked?
6. Day-of kit assembled (contacts, timeline, spares)? Personal cue sheets issued? Offline
   copies exist?
7. Budget: owners per line, contingency present, actuals reconciled after?

## Distilled rules (Kagami fork — DISTILL output, one rule per judgment)

- DISTILL 2026-07-06 (maestro): When one agent's tool count hits 8-12, split into sub-agents
  instead of adding tools (1-3 excellent, 4-7 good, 8-12 degrading, 13+ unreliable).
- DISTILL 2026-07-06 (maestro): Pipeline stages must need zero knowledge of how the prior stage
  produced its output — schema-only contracts; anything else is a design defect.
- DISTILL 2026-07-06 (maestro): Gate "add another agent to the chain" on the multiplicative
  failure rate 1-(1-p)^n, not intuition.
